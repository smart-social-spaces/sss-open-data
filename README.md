# Datasets

## Aggregated Data
The file in the root folder entitled sss_data_DATE.csv contains aggregated, compiled, cleaned and parsed data from a number of sources under the smart social spaces trial, such as weather, proximity, sound, vibration, water and energy usage. This data is in timeseries CSV format and can be opened with most major data processing tools. 

## Sound Data
This is the raw sound level data collected from a number of bench sites. It does NOT contain audio - it is a high-resolution timeseries of sound level recordings in dB taken from a range of sites in the study. This data is raw and has not been parsed or sampled. For a simplified version sampled at 5-minute intervals, see the main aggregated data file described above. 

## BBQ Data
This folder contains data relating to the use of barbecue areas under the smart social spaces study. It has been edited for clarity and contains a number of graphic visualisations to aid in analysis, in excel format.
